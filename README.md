# Google Fonts Installer

This application will download and install the Google Fonts pack for you. This allows you to painlessly have access to thousands of fonts.

It currently only runs on Windows, but when I feel like it I will write a Linux platform installer. If you want to do it for me, feel free to submit a PR. 

All fonts are sourced from <https://github.com/google/fonts>
